### **3. Before vs. After Renovation Analysis**
A comparative dashboard was built to visualize:

#### **Before Renovation (2 Bed / 1 Bath)**
- Shows the original price distribution of the listing.
- Lower pricing range relative to renovated state.

#### **After Renovation (3 Bed / 2 Bath)**
- Expanded layout significantly increases price range.
- Clear upward shift in common nightly rates.
